`TODO(dmi): Fill this with some info.`

## TODO

- [ ] Script the setup!
- [ ] Update the scoop list.
- [ ] Make sure OpenSSH agent service is running (script!).

## Env variables

`HOME`    -> `C:\Users\%USERNAME%`
`SCOOP`   -> somewhere, _before_ the Scoop install.
`GIT_SSH` -> `C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe`

## Etc

Powershell looks for the profile file in `$PROFILE`, which is usually
the `~/Documents/Windows/PowerShell/`.
